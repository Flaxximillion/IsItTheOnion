<h1>Is It The Onion? - A scraper built to test your Oniony-ness</h1>

<p>This application scrapes the subreddits /r/NotTheOnion and /r/TheOnion, storing the posts found to a MongoDB database and allowing users to leave comments and guess which subreddit it came from.</p>

<p><strong>TODO:</strong> Parse for duplicate articles, optimize performance, add pages instead of having one giant HTML file, delete old posts.</p>
